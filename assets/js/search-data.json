            "content": "Tour of Fastpages . . GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes files straight from a repository on GitHub,runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. Fastpages is built on top of GitHub pages. Fastpages automates the process of creating blog posts, so you don’t have to manually run conversion scripts. This tour begins by looking at Explorer in VS Code. There are three automations to a GH Pages / Fastpages website... . _notebooks: jupyter .ipynb files. This allows building block of markdown, python, java, javascript into a jupyter notebook. | _posts: markdown .md files. This supports frontend web design with markdown, html, and javascript. | _word: word .docx files. This allows you to save Microsoft or Goggle documents into a docx format. Saving these directly to _word folder will streamline steps. | . Read more or review files in the fastpages README.md . . Resources . There are many resources, tutorials, and reference for building pages with HTML and Markdown. On these subjects, I would say learn it when you need it. Right clicking on Chrome provides View Page Source on any link on the Web. The APCSA/APCSP projects have many examples within these projects. Here are a couple of Web links I often find through google or refer to when looking for ideas … . HTML on W3Schools | Markdown Cheat Sheet | . Home Page . The Home page is sourced by the index.html file. This is the file to personalize and customize your Fastpages home page. BTW, index.html is the standard name for your web sites landing page. GH Pages / Fastpages builds allows you to mix Markdown and HTML&lt;/mark&gt; within the index.html file. . Sub Pages . Look under _pages folder within the Navigator. In this directory, there are several .md files. These allow a combination of HTML and Markdown. Observe that this project has prefix of 01, 02, 03 on the .md files allows control the order of menus from left to right… . 01_search.md: This provides a very cool search on the site. The search.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 02_tags.md: This provide a very cool tagging system that is related to the “categories: categoryname” that are seen at the top of all the GH Pages / Fastpages _posts. This tags.md is renamed but the contents are untouched from fastpages project. | 03_about.md: This page is left for your individual customization, similar to index.html | Developers can add .md file of choice and order according to preference. | . Images . Look under images folder and you will see files added to support the site. Some are for customization of the site others are for pages. . Site: favicon.ico, logo.png | Pages: agile.webp, apcsa.png | . GH Pages YAML files . The _config.yml has many strings and preferences that are specific to the site. The file is full of comments that describe what can be changed and what should remain untouched. Note, the .yml files will be seen again as we begin to deploy our own site with Docker. . Hacks . Personalize index.html file and build your own Fastpages / GH Pages for personal use throughout the year. . Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year. | Add some personal study or work pages. Consider how you will use these in conjunction with notes/vocab pages, search, and tagging. Publish _notebook file | Publish _post file with image | Publish _docx file from Google Doc source | . | . Extra Credit . Consider using your home page for other subjects other than Computer Science. The searching and tagging features are very powerful and could help recall. .",

In my first watch of this video, right after 2021-2022 school year, these were my observations in improving the well being of Computer Science at Del Norte. . The Teacher needs to reduce academic stress on students. | The Teacher needs to convince Students to form habits of successful people, as discussed in the video. These habits need to be formed collaboratively between Teacher and Student. | Students need to strive to form an attitude of success for life. This takes effort and commitment. Similar to exercise analogies discussed in video. | In active discussions with Ms Naidu who taught at Del Norte in 2021-2022, we determined the biggest weakness in students our students is Collaboration, not Technical. | Laure Santos request that students be grateful for their current situation. | . Teacher Message . The AP Computer Science classes at Del Norte in 2022-2023 is structured to do most of the work in the classroom. Students, please prioritize the 4C habits: Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking and Creativity in classroom. Additionally, focus, ask questions, Code/Code/Code&lt;, and make mistakes. If you do these things, you are in danger of getting 90% on all your assignments. . Agile and Psychology of the Good Life . A lot of the way we go Agile, Sprints, and Scrums is helping to establish habits and focus. As Engineers, we need to learn to put things together and not consider everything as disparate. . Habit helpers: Stand-up meetings, Issues, Scrum Board, Review Tickets, Sprints | Focus helpers: Reviewing Issues, Pair Coding, Making mistakes, Fixing Bugs, Scrum accountability | . Hacks . Watch and build a vocabulary on the “Psychology and the Good Life” and maintain it on GH Pages, look for connections between Good Life and Agile. | Write a note of gratitude to someone on campus and someone at home, record your experience in GH Pages. | .",

            "content": "Agile Methodology . . Agile software development uses practices such as pair programming, test-driven development, stand-ups, planning sessions, and sprints. Agile includes the 12 Principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. . . Roles . To ensure transparency during the sprint the Team should meet daily at the daily scrum ( sometimes called a standup). As adaptation for classroom, Team should have a standup meeting for weekly plans, should have assignments for tasks, assignments for integration and deployment. . Scrum Master: The scrum master helps to facilitate the sprint by ensuring that an agile framework is followed. He/she is committed to tracking issues and maintaining scrum boards, but should also remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow. | DevOps: DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an team’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: version control, integration, managing dependencies, POM file management, AWS deployment are some of the key functions that impact velocity. | Development Team: The development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, presenters, developers, etc. Two key roles in Web Development are … Frontend Developer: A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. | Backend Developer: Back-end developers a build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions like data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see. | . | . Workload . When planning there is an expectation of time. . Individual in Class Time. You should expect 3 to 4 hours of productive classroom work each week. | Individual at Home Time. To maintain pace in this class, you should consider a 2 hour coding or design session (weekly) outside of class time. | Sprint Calculation Time. 5-6 hours of coding or planning per week per individual, or 20-24 hours per team. If we had a two week Sprint this would be 40-48 hours of work. | Key to success. Make great use of time in class. Pair share programming typically provides three time dividend over individual programming when you are learning something new. | . Issues . Sprint cadences have ideas/issues that are broken into short term work units called tasks. . Scrum Board / GitHub Project / Kanban Style . The Scrum Board contains issues that are assigned to individuals, each of these issues will have tangible deliverable links (code/video/…). Scrum Team will use Scrum Board to understand everyone’s ideas and efforts. This includes individual tasks. Use GitHub Projects add Issues to the board. Issues are placed in columns on a Scrum Board (Kanban) to represent progress. The below columns have been successful in our academic environment. . To do/backlog | In progress | Complete | Deployed | Done | Sprint . Sprint is a period of time that Team uses to plan work and execute work. This includes planning, research, development, deployment, and test. Typically, sprints will be 2 weeks or longer in the classroom. Anytime a sprint lasts longer than a week, there will be a weekly Review Tickets (formative assessment) and concluding with an end of Review Ticket (summative assessment). Sample sprint follows… . Week 1 Monday - Sprint Objectives, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 2, formative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | Week 2 Monday - Sprint Crossover Grading, Scrum Team Planning | Tuesday - Test Prep Tuesday (Student Led) | Wednesday - Code, Code, Code | Thursday - Tech Talk (Teacher) | Friday - Code, Code, Code; Teacher 1 v 4 including Demos/Review Ticket/Peer, summative review | 2 hours outside of class for project work | . | . Assessments / Reviews . During Teacher reviews meetings ( 1 v 2 pair, 1 v 4 team), the pair or team will provide Teacher with an Issues that that will be called a Review Ticket. The issue will be completed, referencing Tasks Completed and Self/Crossover Score(s). Canvas should be used as a guide to completing a review ticket, make sure you account for everything. Make sure Point total is a the top of ticket, if points are important to you! . Hacks . Key deliverables of this Tech Talk… .

A Computer, Git, and an Code Editor are the starting points for coding. . Computers using either MacOS, Windows, or Linux are requirements for the course. | GitHub, is Git hosted in the Cloud. It is the defacto hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Think of it as the Google Docs for Coders. Version Control is the task of keeping a software system of many versions and configurations well organized. | Version Control History of files and changes in Version Control System (ie GitHub) is very important! Ultimately, any Coder will break things or delete things! Looking at older versions and configurations at a microscopic detail is sometimes the only way to unwind bugs. | . | Visual Studio Code (abbreviations VS Code, VSCode or VSC) is a powerful Code Editor. VSCode performs a lot of magic and automation behind the scenes to make your Code/Code/Coding life easier. There is a back-in-the-day story hear, but short version is VSCode qualifies, IMO, to be called and Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It allows you to Edit files, Build your Code, and Pull/Push Code from and to the GitHub. FYI, VSCode is new to APCS this year, former IDE’s used in CompSci classes include XCode, Eclipse, and IntelliJ. | Jupyter Documents (.ipynb) is a document format for creating and sharing computational documents. These documents allow you to compute segments of Python or Java code as you are taking notes. These are new to AP CS this year, but are viewed as very powerful in gaining a quick understanding of coding concepts. Jupyter documents are often called “notebooks”. | . Equipment, accounts and tools . A laptop, bring a laptop to class every day with the Development Tools installed on it. Computers issued by the School, ie Chromebook, are not effective because of the restrictions placed on adding software by PUSD. If you have any problems obtaining a Computer where you can install software!, please attend Office Hours immediately | GitHub Account, VSCode will be used to clone/push/pull changes.

VSCode Marketplace and Extensions . . Visual Studio Code claims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug and version control cycle. It provides a Market Place for enhancements and more complex workflows. Before adding extensions, clone projects and see what is requested or added. Here are some extension that were added through that process or that I have added... . Extension Pack for Java, Debugger for Java: These are fundamental for Java Development | Jupyter: This supports build jupyter ipynb files from within VS Code | Code Spell Checker: Got to have it when building documents, particularly if you spell and typo like the Teacher. | IntelliCode: Got to have it when creating a code file, it will sense type of code by extension. Also, it help with syntax as you are coding. | Java / Spring behind the scenes | : Language Support for Java, Maven for Java, Project Manager for Java, Spring Boot Dashboard, Spring Boot Extension Pack, Spring Initializr Java Support, Test Runner for Java&lt;/li&gt; . Review Details in Marketplace for better explanation of purpose of the things explained above. There is a lot more! As you need Git help look at things like Git History and GitLens. Or, perhaps you enjoy Vim and want Vim emulation for editing, their is an extension for that. Later, there may be interest in AWS Toolkit or Deploy extensions. We will learn more about Marketplace Extensions as we do more. . . Hacks . Students need to demonstrate all these tools running to Scrum Team and then the Teacher. Issues need to be worked out quickly. Before asking Teacher ask 3 other students. Do not delay in Tool Setup task, there will be no late makeup for points!!!

All code you develop will be delivered to the Cloud. | Grading guidelines. There will be key technical objectives which will require producing tangibles. Essentially, it is impossible to be late with work if you work consistently attend class, work in class and turn in progressive tangibles each week. Thus, failure to have work will result in a 10% deduction. Additionally, late work must be defended in office hours. High “A” is very tough to achieve, something beyond the tangible requirements.

            "content": "Hello, World! . These examples show the basic language structures and constructs of Java (aka anatomy). . Static example . The class HelloStatic contains the classic introduction to Java anatomy. The &quot;public static void main(String[] args)&quot;, or main method, is the default runtime method and has a very specific definition (signature). . // Define Static Method within a Class public class HelloStatic { // Java standard runtime entry point public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;); } } // IJava only allows us to rexecute code without be wrapped in Class HelloStatic.main(null); // Class prefix allows reference of Static Method . Hello World! . Dynamic Example . This example starts to use Java in its natural manner, objects. The main method is now used as a driver/tester, by making an instance of the class. It creates an Object using the HelloObject() constructor. Also, this Class contains a getter method called getHello() which returns a String. . // Define Class with Constructor returning Object public class HelloObject { private String hello; public HelloObject() { // constructor hello = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; } public String getHello() { return this.hello; // return String from object } public static void main(String[] args) { HelloObject ho = new HelloObject(); // Instance of Class (ho) is an Object via &quot;new HelloObject()&quot; System.out.println(ho.getHello()); // Object allows reference to public methods and data } } // IJava activation HelloObject.main(null); . Hello, World! . Dynamic Example with two constructors . This last example adds to the basics of the Java anatomy. The Class now contains two constructors and a setter to go with the getter. Also, observe the driver/tester now contains two objects that are intialized differently, 0 and 1 argument constructor. Look at the usage of the &quot;this&quot; prefix. The &quot;this&quot; keyword helps in clarification between instance and local variable. . // Define Class with Constructor returning Object public class HelloDynamic { private String hello; // constructor with no arguement signature public HelloDynamic() { this.setHello(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); // using setter } // constructor with one argument signature public HelloDynamic(String hello) { this.setHello(hello); } // setter with void return public void setHello(String hello) { this.hello = hello; // instance variable on the left, local variable on the right } // getter with String return public String getHello() { return this.hello; } public static void main(String[] args) { HelloDynamic hd1 = new HelloDynamic(); // no argument constructor HelloDynamic hd2 = new HelloDynamic(&quot;Hello, Nighthawk Coding Society!&quot;); // one argument constructor System.out.println(hd1.getHello()); // accessing getter System.out.println(hd2.getHello()); } } // IJava activation HelloDynamic.main(null); . Hello, World! Hello, Nighthawk Coding Society! . Hacks . Build your own Jupyter Notebook meeting these College Board and CTE competencies . Explain Anatomy of a Class in comments of program (Key parts of the class) | Comment in code where there is a definition of a Class and an instance of a Class (ie object) | Comment in code where there are constructors and highlight the signature difference in the signature | Call non-static void methods with parameter (ie setters). | . Additional requirements .
